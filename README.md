# BeagleBone-Black-TIPinMux
Design and source files generated by the TI Pin Mux Tool for the BeagleBone Black.

Even though many people working with Pin Muxing run on Linux TI's tool only runs on Windows, and therefore myself and others were having a hard time finding a starting point to use this awesome tool to allocate pins.

Everyone spin up your favorite version of Windows in a VM on your trusty Linux box and give it a whorl!

# Known issues
The current version only provides the muxes for the user accessable pins, but hopefully myself and others will be able to expand this resource to cover all onboard devices on the BBB.
